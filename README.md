---

This Python-based tool allows network monitoring professionals and security enthusiasts to quickly launch **Ettercap**, **Bettercap**, and **Wireshark** for packet sniffing and MITM analysis on a selected target IP and interface. It also analyzes PCAP files, filtering packets by URL and/or IP, and displays which domains were visited by a specific IP along with timestamps and visit status.

## Features

1. **Custom Packet Filter Generator**: Automatically generates and compiles an Ettercap filter file to drop traffic from all IPs except the target. 
2.  **Wireshark Auto-Launch with Filters**: Opens Wireshark with a live display filter for the target IP and optionally filtered domains from `url_file.txt`.   
3.  **PCAP Analyzer**: This tool allows you to analyze PCAP files and filter packets based on a specific URL and/or IP address. It shows which domains were visited by a particular IP, including timestamps and visit status.

## Installation (with pip)
```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb2rS2c/StealthChopper/refs/heads/main/setup_pip.sh
sudo chmod +x setup_pip.sh; source ./setup_pip.sh; stealth-chopper
```
***For more info:***
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyb2rS2c/StealthChopper.git
cd StealthChopper
```

2. Install the required Python dependencies and run the program (**Interactive**):

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh;source ./setup.sh
```

## Usage

Run the script as root, specifying the target IP and interface as arguments:

### Option1 (Manually)
```bash
sudo python3 src/listenOnSomeOne.py <target_ip> <interface>
```
### Option2 (Wizard)

```bash
sudo python3 src/listenOnSomeOne.py --scan
```
### Option3
```bash
sudo python3 src/listenOnSomeOne.py --interactive
```

**Example:**

```bash
sudo python3 listenOnSomeOne.py 192.168.1.121 wlan0
```
- `<target_ip>`: The single IPv4 address you want to target.
- `<interface>`: The network interface to use (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).

**The script will:**

    1-Validate your IP and interface input.
    2-Ensure url_file.txt exists (generates it via common_url.py if missing).
    3-Create a custom filter file excluding all other IPs.
    4-Compile the filter file for Ettercap.
    5-Launch Ettercap, Bettercap, and Wireshark in separate terminal sessions.
    6-Apply a Wireshark filter for target IP and optionally domains from url_file.txt.
    Tip: Press Ctrl+C in the main terminal to exit gracefully.

# PCAP Analyzer

## Usage
```
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f <pcap_file> -s [filter_url] -i [filter_ip] -c [country] -t [HH:MM:SS | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
```


**Example:**

### 1. Check if a user has visited `linkedin.com` from a specific IP address:

```bash
# Check if the user with IP "192.168.1.121" has visited "linkedin.com"
# If so, it will show the visit time and other useful details.
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -s ".*linkedin.com" -i "192.168.1.121"

# Alternatively, you can search for just "linkedin" (without the full domain).
# This will match any domain containing "linkedin" like linkedin.com etc.
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -s "linkedin" -i "192.168.1.121"
```
### 2. Check all websites visited by a user with a specific IP address:
```bash
# This will display all the domains the user has queried in the PCAP.
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -i "192.168.1.121"
```
### 3. Check all users who have visited linkedin.com:
```bash
# This will display all users who have visited any domain containing "linkedin".
# It shows the visit status, including the time of visit.
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -s "linkedin"
```
### 4. Check users by country:
```bash
# This will display all users who have visited any domain containing "linkedin".
# It filters results by country, showing only visits from users in the specified country (e.g., US).
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -s "linkedin" -c "US"
```
### 5. Check users by specific visit time:
```
# This will display all users who visited any domain containing "linkedin" on a specific date and time (e.g., "2025-12-07 13:20:30").
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -s "linkedin" -t "2025-12-07 13:20:30"
```

### 6. New Features / Changes

The following columns have been added and can now be filtered:

***Vendor*** - the manufacturer of the device, based on the MAC address.

***MAC Address*** - the device’s network interface identifier.

***Hostname*** - the resolved name of the device.
```bash
# Example
python3 src/process_pcap.py -f 192.168.0.121_filtered_activity.pcap -v "Liteon" -H "router" -m "00:00:00:00:00:00"
```

**Tip:** Use Regex for domain filtering as shown in the example above if you don't want to enter the full FQDN.

### 6. Help
#### To get help on how to use the script, you can view the usage instructions with the following commands:

```bash
python3 src/listenOnSomeOne.py -h
``` 
#### For PCAP analyzer type:
```bash
python3 src/process_pcap.py -h
#OR
python3 src/process_pcap.py 
```
